# Spec-Driven With ADR OpenSpec Schema

`spec-driven-with-adr` is for changes that need the standard proposal-to-tasks
OpenSpec flow plus durable Architecture Decision Records.

- Good fit: architectural changes, platform decisions, cross-module work, new
  service boundaries, technology choices, or changes where future contributors
  need a persistent decision trail.
- Not a good fit: small tactical fixes, content-only edits, simple UI changes,
  or work where `specs -> tasks` is enough.

## Install (copy/paste)

Use the root `README.md` single-line install command with:
- `SCHEMA="spec-driven-with-adr"`

## Activate

Set this in `openspec/config.yaml`:

```yaml
schema: spec-driven-with-adr
```

## Stage Gates

Artifact order:
`proposal -> specs -> design -> adr -> tasks`

Gate expectations:
- `specs` must be based on the capabilities identified in `proposal.md`.
- `design` must account for the proposal, specs, and currently in-force ADRs.
- `adr` completes by writing `openspec/changes/<change>/adr.md`, a concise
  ADR review manifest created after design and before task planning.
- `tasks` are planned only after proposal, specs, design, and ADR artifacts are
  complete.

## ADR Persistence

`openspec/changes/<change>/adr.md` is the per-change ADR review artifact used
for OpenSpec artifact completion. It records that ADR review happened, lists
the in-force ADR context that was reviewed, and references any durable ADR files
created for the change.

Durable ADR files are generated under the target repository's top-level `adr/`
folder, not inside the OpenSpec change folder. Create
`adr/NNNN-kebab-title.md` only when the change introduces a major durable
architectural decision. Accepted ADRs are immutable. If a future decision
changes a prior ADR, create a new ADR that supersedes the old one and leave the
original file unchanged.

- For ADR skills please refer to: [Intent-Driven-Template Skills](https://github.com/intent-driven-dev/intent-driven-template/tree/main/.agents/skills/architectural-decision-records).
- This skill takes care of choosing the ADR style/template used by this schema.

## Pending

- Package schema and associated skills together.
